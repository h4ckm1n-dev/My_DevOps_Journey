# Wireshark Cheat Sheet

Wireshark is a popular network protocol analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, and packet inspection. This cheat sheet provides commands and techniques for effective usage of Wireshark.

## Capture and Filtering

COMMAND | DESCRIPTION
---|---
`wireshark` | Launch Wireshark application
`tcpdump -i <interface> -w <output_file>` | Capture network traffic and save to a file for analysis in Wireshark
`wireshark -r <input_file>` | Open a captured packet file in Wireshark for analysis
`tcpdump -i <interface> <filter_expression>` | Capture network traffic using a specific filter expression
`wireshark <filter_expression>` | Apply a filter expression to an open capture

## Display Filters

COMMAND | DESCRIPTION
---|---
`ip.addr == <ip_address>` | Filter packets based on IP address
`tcp.port == <port_number>` | Filter packets based on TCP port
`http` | Filter packets based on HTTP protocol
`ssl` | Filter packets based on SSL/TLS encryption
`dns` | Filter packets based on DNS protocol
`icmp` | Filter packets based on ICMP protocol

## Analyzing Packets

COMMAND | DESCRIPTION
---|---
`Follow > TCP Stream` | View the entire TCP stream of a selected packet
`Follow > UDP Stream` | View the entire UDP stream of a selected packet
`Statistics > Conversations` | View network conversations and statistics
`Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy` | View the distribution of protocols in the captured packets
`Statistics > IO Graph` | Generate input/output graph for traffic analysis
`Analyze > Expert Info` | View expert information and analysis of captured packets

## Protocol Analysis

COMMAND | DESCRIPTION
---|---
`Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy` | Analyze the distribution of protocols in the captured packets
`Analyze > Decode As` | Decode packets as a specific protocol or port
`Analyze > Follow > <Protocol>` | Follow a specific protocol stream for in-depth analysis

## Exporting Data

COMMAND | DESCRIPTION
---|---
`File > Export Objects` | Export files transferred over a network (e.g., images, documents)
`File > Export Packet Dissections` | Export packet dissections to a file for further analysis

## Statistics and Performance

COMMAND | DESCRIPTION
---|---
`Statistics > Summary` | View summary statistics of the captured packets
`Statistics > IO Graph` | Generate input/output graph for traffic analysis
`Statistics > Flow Graph` | Generate flow graph for traffic analysis
`Statistics > Endpoints` | View endpoints and associated statistics
