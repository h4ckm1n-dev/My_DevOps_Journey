Teleport is an open-source, modern, and secure remote access and privilege access management (PAM) solution. It provides a unified gateway for accessing SSH servers, Kubernetes clusters, and other web applications, while also offering session recording, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control. Teleport enhances the security and audibility of remote access to critical infrastructure and resources. Here are some key concepts and commands related to Teleport:

## Key Concepts

- **Teleport Cluster**: A collection of Teleport nodes and authentication services working together.
- **Teleport Node**: A machine or server running the Teleport daemon, which acts as a gateway for secure access.
- **User**: An individual who accesses resources through Teleport.
- **Roles**: Define a set of permissions and access levels for users.
- **Auth Connector**: External authentication methods like LDAP or SAML that can be integrated with Teleport.
- **Session Recording**: Teleport can record user sessions for auditing and compliance purposes.
- **Web UI**: Teleport provides a web-based user interface for managing users, roles, and resources.

## Teleport CLI (tctl)

The Teleport Command-Line Interface (CLI) tool, `tctl`, allows administrators to manage Teleport clusters and resources. Here are some commonly used commands:

|COMMAND|DESCRIPTION|
|---|---|
|`tctl status`|Display the Teleport cluster status|
|`tctl nodes ls`|List all registered Teleport nodes|
|`tctl users add <username>`|Create a new user|
|`tctl users ls`|List all registered users|
|`tctl roles add <rolename>`|Create a new role|
|`tctl roles ls`|List all registered roles|
|`tctl access request`|Request access to a resource|
|`tctl sessions ls`|List recorded user sessions|
|`tctl auth connectors add <connector_type>`|Add an authentication connector (LDAP, SAML, etc.)|
|`tctl web`|Open the Teleport Web UI|

## Teleport Web UI

The Teleport Web UI provides a graphical user interface for managing and configuring Teleport. It allows administrators to perform various tasks, including user management, role assignments, authentication connector setup, and resource access control. The Web UI offers an intuitive interface for navigating through the different sections and configuring Teleport to suit your organization's needs.

When using the Teleport Web UI, you can access and manage user accounts, roles, authentication connectors, and resource permissions.
