# Kubernetes Administration Notebook

### Overview

Kubernetes, often referred to as K8s, is a powerful open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Kubernetes provides a robust and flexible infrastructure for running distributed systems and microservices, making it a popular choice for organizations moving towards a cloud-native approach.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Pods**: Pods are the smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy. A Pod encapsulates an application container (or, in some cases, multiple containers), storage resources, a unique network IP, and options that govern how the container(s) should run. Pods are designed to support co-located (co-scheduled), co-managed helper programs, such as content management systems, file and data loaders, local cache managers, etc.
    
- **Services**: In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them, sometimes called a micro-service. The set of Pods targeted by a Service is usually determined by a selector. Services without selectors and those that do not point to any Pods are also possible scenarios. Services enable decoupled application components to communicate easily, providing discovery and routing functionality.
    
- **Deployments**: A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. This allows for easy management of application versions, scaling of resources, and rollbacks to previous states.
    
- **ReplicaSets**: A ReplicaSets purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods. They are particularly useful in ensuring high availability and fault tolerance of applications.
    
- **Kubernetes Architecture**:
    
    - **Master Nodes**: The master nodes are the heart of a Kubernetes cluster, responsible for maintaining the desired state, such as which applications are running and which container images they use. Key components of the master node include the `etcd` key-value store for all cluster data, the `kube-apiserver` which exposes the Kubernetes API, the `kube-controller-manager` which runs controllers for nodes, replication, endpoints, and service accounts, and the `kube-scheduler` which schedules the Pods.
    - **Worker Nodes**: Worker nodes are the machines where the actual workloads specified by the user are run. Each worker node runs a `kubelet`, a tiny application that communicates with the master node, and a `kube-proxy`, a network proxy which reflects services as defined in Kubernetes API on each node. The nodes also run the container runtime, like Docker or containerd, which takes care of pulling images and running containers.

Understanding the architecture and components of Kubernetes is vital for effectively managing and troubleshooting a Kubernetes cluster. It provides the foundation for exploring more advanced features and use cases of the platform.

### Getting Started

Installing Kubernetes:

Kubernetes can be installed and run in various environments, from your local machine to cloud providers. The choice of environment depends on your use case.

- For local development and testing, you can use tools like **Minikube** or **kind**. Minikube is a tool that lets you run Kubernetes locally. It runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster on your personal computer so that you can try out Kubernetes, or for daily development work. On the other hand, kind lets you run Kubernetes on your local computer and requires that you have Docker or Podman installed. These tools provide a lightweight Kubernetes environment that runs on a single machine, making it ideal for individuals who are just getting started with Kubernetes.
    
- For production-grade clusters, you can use tools like **kubeadm**, **kops**, or **Rancher**. Kubeadm is a tool that helps you bootstrap a minimum viable Kubernetes cluster that conforms to best practices. With kubeadm, your cluster should pass the Kubernetes Conformance tests. Kubeadm also supports other cluster lifecycle functions, such as upgrades, downgrade, and managing bootstrap tokens. These tools help you deploy and manage Kubernetes clusters on various infrastructure providers, including on-premises or cloud environments.
    
- Managed Kubernetes services like **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**, **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**, and **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** offer fully managed Kubernetes clusters. These services abstract away the underlying infrastructure management, allowing you to focus on deploying and running applications. They also provide additional features like automatic scaling, updates, and enterprise-level security.
    

Exploring Kubernetes Dashboard:

- Kubernetes Dashboard is a web-based graphical user interface that allows you to manage your Kubernetes cluster. It provides a visual representation of your cluster and allows you to interact with it and manage its resources. You can use the Dashboard to deploy containerized applications to a Kubernetes cluster, troubleshoot your containerized application, and manage the cluster resources.
    
- Accessing the Kubernetes Dashboard involves running the `kubectl proxy` command in your command line, which makes the Dashboard available at `http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/`. The Dashboard can only be accessed from the machine where the command is executed. Once the Dashboard is accessible, you can use it to view the state of Kubernetes resources in your cluster and on any errors that may have occurred.
    

By following the installation steps and exploring the Kubernetes Dashboard, you can get started with Kubernetes and begin managing your applications and resources in the cluster.

### Basic Operations

Interacting with the cluster:

- The primary command-line tool for interacting with Kubernetes is `kubectl`. It allows you to manage and control your Kubernetes cluster from the command line.

Basic `kubectl` commands:

- `kubectl get`: Used to retrieve information about different Kubernetes resources. For example, `kubectl get pods` lists all the pods running in the cluster.
- `kubectl create`: Used to create resources in the cluster based on configuration files or command-line arguments. For example, `kubectl create deployment` creates a new deployment.
- `kubectl describe`: Provides detailed information about a specific resource. For example, `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>` shows detailed information about a specific pod.
- `kubectl delete`: Used to delete resources from the cluster. For example, `kubectl delete pod <pod-name>` deletes a specific pod.
- `kubectl apply`: Applies changes to resources defined in a configuration file. For example, `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml` applies the changes specified in the deployment configuration file.
- `kubectl edit`: Opens the specified resource in an editor, allowing you to modify its configuration.

Managing namespaces:

- Namespaces provide a way to partition resources within a Kubernetes cluster. They help organize and isolate resources based on different projects, teams, or environments.
- You can create a namespace using the `kubectl create namespace` command, switch to a specific namespace using `kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<namespace>`, and delete a namespace using `kubectl delete namespace <namespace>`.

Accessing and working with cluster resources:

- Kubernetes provides various resources for managing applications, including Pods, Deployments, Services, ReplicaSets, ConfigMaps, Secrets, and more.
- Pods are the smallest deployable units in Kubernetes, containing one or more containers.
- Deployments define the desired state for managing and scaling Pods.
- Services enable communication between different Pods or external clients.
- ReplicaSets ensure a specified number of Pod replicas are running at all times.
- ConfigMaps and Secrets allow you to store and manage configuration data and sensitive information, respectively.
- You can interact with these resources using `kubectl` commands specific to each resource type, such as `kubectl get pods`, `kubectl describe deployment`, `kubectl delete service`, and so on.

By mastering these basic `kubectl` commands and understanding how to work with different Kubernetes resources, you'll be able to effectively manage and operate your Kubernetes cluster.

### Kubernetes Objects
Pods:
- Pods are the smallest and most basic unit in Kubernetes. They encapsulate one or more containers and associated resources, such as storage volumes and network settings.
- You can create Pods using YAML or JSON configuration files, specifying the container image, ports, environment variables, and other necessary configurations.
- Managing Pods involves creating, updating, and deleting them using `kubectl` commands. You can also troubleshoot Pods by inspecting their logs and connecting to them using `kubectl exec` command.

Deployments:

- Deployments provide a declarative way to manage and scale applications in Kubernetes.
- You can define a Deployment configuration that specifies the desired state of the application, including the number of replicas, container images, resource limits, and update strategy.
- Deployments enable rolling updates, which allow you to update an application without downtime by gradually replacing old Pods with new ones.
- Scaling a Deployment can be done using the `kubectl scale` command to increase or decrease the number of replicas.

Services:

- Services provide a stable network endpoint to access and communicate with a group of Pods.
- They enable service discovery and load balancing, allowing applications to dynamically discover and connect to other services.
- There are different types of Services, including ClusterIP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer, each serving different purposes.
- You can create Services using YAML or JSON configuration files or by running `kubectl expose` command.

ReplicaSets:

- ReplicaSets ensure a specified number of identical Pods are running at all times.
- They are often used by Deployments to maintain the desired number of replicas.
- ReplicaSets handle scaling and self-healing of Pods, creating new replicas if any Pods fail or are terminated.
- You can create and manage ReplicaSets using YAML or JSON configuration files or by using `kubectl` commands.

ConfigMaps and Secrets:

- ConfigMaps are used to store and manage configuration data that can be consumed by Pods.
- Secrets are similar to ConfigMaps but are specifically designed for sensitive information, such as passwords, API keys, and certificates.
- Both ConfigMaps and Secrets can be used to provide configuration data to applications running in Pods.
- You can create ConfigMaps and Secrets using YAML or JSON configuration files or by running `kubectl create configmap` or `kubectl create secret` commands.

Ingress:

- Ingress provides an external access point to services within a Kubernetes cluster.
- It allows you to route incoming traffic from outside the cluster to specific services based on rules and hostnames.
- Ingress resources are created using YAML or JSON configuration files or by running `kubectl apply` command.

Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims:

- Persistent Volumes (PVs) provide persistent storage in Kubernetes, decoupled from Pods.
- Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) are requests for specific storage resources, such as size and access mode.
- PVCs can be bound to PVs to provide storage to Pods.
- You can create PVs and PVCs using YAML or JSON configuration files or by running `kubectl create` command.

StatefulSets:

- StatefulSets are used to manage stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage.
- They provide unique network identifiers and ordered pod creation and termination.
- StatefulSets are often used for applications like databases, where each instance requires unique storage and network settings.
- You can create and manage StatefulSets using YAML or JSON configuration files or by using `kubectl` commands.

Jobs and CronJobs:

- Jobs are used to run batch processes or one-time tasks in Kubernetes.
- CronJobs are used to schedule recurring tasks based on a cron schedule.
- You can define Jobs and CronJobs using YAML or JSON configuration files or by running `kubectl apply` command.

Understanding and effectively using these Kubernetes objects will enable you to deploy, manage, and scale your applications in a more efficient and reliable manner.

### Advanced Topics
Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs):

- CRDs allow you to define and manage custom resources in Kubernetes.
- You can create custom resources with their own lifecycle and behavior, extending the Kubernetes API.
- CRDs are created using YAML or JSON configuration files and can be managed using `kubectl` commands.

Operators:

- Kubernetes operators are software extensions that automate the management of complex applications or services.
- They use custom controllers to watch and react to changes in resources, providing automation and self-healing capabilities.
- Operators are typically created for stateful applications and provide higher-level abstractions to manage their lifecycle.

Customizing Kubernetes with Helm:

- Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies application deployment and management.
- It uses charts, which are packages containing pre-configured Kubernetes resources, to deploy applications.
- Helm provides templating capabilities for customization, making it easier to manage complex deployments.

Network Policies:

- Network Policies allow you to define rules to control network traffic within the Kubernetes cluster.
- They provide fine-grained control over inbound and outbound traffic, allowing you to enforce security policies.
- Network Policies are created using YAML or JSON configuration files and can be applied using `kubectl` commands.

Resource Quotas and Limitations:

- Resource Quotas allow you to limit and manage resource allocation for namespaces or users in a Kubernetes cluster.
- They help ensure fair usage and prevent resource exhaustion.
- Quotas can be set for CPU, memory, storage, and other resource types using YAML or JSON configuration files.

Autoscaling:

- Kubernetes provides two types of autoscaling: Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) and Vertical Pod Autoscaling (VPA).
- HPA automatically adjusts the number of replicas based on resource utilization metrics.
- VPA adjusts the resource limits of individual Pods based on their resource usage patterns.

High Availability and Disaster Recovery:

- High Availability (HA) involves setting up redundant components to minimize downtime in case of failures.
- Disaster Recovery (DR) involves planning and implementing strategies to recover from catastrophic events.
- Kubernetes provides features such as Pod replicas, node failure handling, and backup and restore mechanisms to achieve HA and DR.

Logging and Monitoring:

- Monitoring and logging are critical for understanding the health and performance of your Kubernetes cluster and applications.
- Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Elastic Stack (ELK) can be used to collect metrics and logs and visualize them.

Security and RBAC:

- Security is a crucial aspect of Kubernetes administration.
- RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) enables fine-grained control over user access and permissions within the cluster.
- Implementing security best practices, such as securing API server endpoints, enabling authentication, and managing certificates, is essential.

By exploring these advanced topics, you can enhance the capabilities of your Kubernetes cluster, customize it to fit your specific needs, and ensure its security, scalability, and reliability.
