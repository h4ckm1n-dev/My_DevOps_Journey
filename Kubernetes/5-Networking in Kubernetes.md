# Kubernetes Administration Notebook

### Kubernetes Networking Overview
- Introduction to Kubernetes networking.
- Pods, Services, and Ingress resources.
- Cluster IP, NodePort, and LoadBalancer service types.
- Container network interfaces (CNI) and plugins.

### Cluster Networking Architecture
- Understanding the network architecture of a Kubernetes cluster.
- Cluster networking components: kube-proxy, CNI plugin, and network overlay.
- Networking modes: bridge, host, and overlay networks.
- Pod-to-Pod communication within a cluster.

### Service Networking
- Service discovery in Kubernetes.
- Cluster DNS and DNS resolution for service names.
- Creating and managing Services.
- Service endpoints and load balancing.
- Headless Services for direct Pod-to-Pod communication.

### Ingress Controllers
- Introduction to Ingress resources and Ingress controllers.
- Ingress rules and traffic routing.
- Configuring and managing Ingress controllers.
- Load balancing and SSL termination with Ingress.
- Ingress controllers vs. Load Balancers.

### Network Policies
- Implementing network policies in Kubernetes.
- Defining ingress and egress rules.
- Isolating Pods and controlling traffic flow.
- NetworkPolicy resources and selectors.
- Network policy enforcement and validation.
