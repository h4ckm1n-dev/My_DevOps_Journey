Jenkins is an open-source automation server that enables developers to reliably build, test, and deploy their software. It's often associated with the implementation of continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

Here's a basic guide on what Jenkins is and how to use it:

**What is Jenkins?**

Jenkins is a server-based system that runs in servlet containers such as Apache Tomcat. It supports version control tools like Git, Subversion, and Mercurial, and can execute Apache Ant and Apache Maven-based projects as well as arbitrary shell scripts and Windows batch commands.

Jenkins' core functionality is its ability to execute a predefined list of steps, also known as a "job". For example, your job could be to compile source code and build a Docker image. Jenkins can distribute these jobs across multiple machines, helping drive builds, tests and deployments across multiple platforms faster.

**How to Use Jenkins?**

1. **Create a New Job**: On the Jenkins dashboard, click on "New Item". Enter a name for the job, select the type of the job you want to execute (e.g., "Freestyle project"), and click "OK".
    
2. **Configure the Job**: In the configuration page, you can set various parameters for the job such as:
    
    - **Source Code Management**: Specify the source code location (e.g., Git repository) and credentials if needed.
        
    - **Build Triggers**: Define when to run the job. It could be periodically, after another job has been executed, or whenever a change is pushed to the repository.
        
    - **Build Environment**: Set up the environment in which the job will be run.
        
    - **Build**: Specify the actual steps that the job will execute. This could be invoking a script, running a shell command, etc.
        
    - **Post-build Actions**: Specify actions to be taken after the build has been executed, such as sending notifications, archiving the build results, etc.
        
3. **Save and Execute the Job**: Once you've configured the job, click "Save". You can then click "Build Now" on the job page to execute the job immediately.
    
4. **Review the Build Results**: After the job has been executed, the build result will be displayed in the "Build History" section. Click on the build number to see more details. If the build failed, you can check the console output to see what went wrong.
    

Remember, Jenkins is highly extensible with a vast ecosystem of plugins, so you can add more functionality as per your requirements. For example, you can integrate Jenkins with Slack for notifications, use the Docker plugin to build and publish Docker images, or use the Pipeline plugin to model simple-to-complex delivery pipelines as code.
